        <p>
        Using Stack is the obvious way to traverse tree without recursion. 
        Below is an algorithm for traversing binary tree using stack.</p>
        <li>
            <ol>Create an empty stack S.</ol>
            <ol>Initialize current node as root</ol>
            <ol>Push the current node to S and set current = current->left until current is NULL</ol>
            <ol>If current is NULL and stack is not empty then 
                <li>
                    <ol>Pop the top item from stack.</ol>
                    <ol>Print the popped item, set current = popped_item->right </ol>
                    <ol>Go to step 3.</ol>
                </li></ol>
            <ol>If current is NULL and stack is empty then we are done.</ol>
        </li>
        <pre>
              1
            /   \
          2      3
        /  \
      4     5
  
  Step 1 Creates an empty stack: S = NULL
  
  Step 2 sets current as address of root: current -> 1
  
  Step 3 Pushes the current node and set current = current->left 
         until current is NULL
       current -> 1
       push 1: Stack S -> 1
       current -> 2
       push 2: Stack S -> 2, 1
       current -> 4
       push 4: Stack S -> 4, 2, 1
       current = NULL
  
  Step 4 pops from S
       a) Pop 4: Stack S -> 2, 1
       b) print "4"
       c) current = NULL /*right of 4 */ and go to step 3
  Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything. 
  
  Step 4 pops again.
       a) Pop 2: Stack S -> 1
       b) print "2"
       c) current -> 5/*right of 2 */ and go to step 3
  
  Step 3 pushes 5 to stack and makes current NULL
       Stack S -> 5, 1
       current = NULL
  
  Step 4 pops from S
       a) Pop 5: Stack S -> 1
       b) print "5"
       c) current = NULL /*right of 5 */ and go to step 3
  Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything
  
  Step 4 pops again.
       a) Pop 1: Stack S -> NULL
       b) print "1"
       c) current -> 3 /*right of 1 */  
  
  Step 3 pushes 3 to stack and makes current NULL
       Stack S -> 3
       current = NULL
  
  Step 4 pops from S
       a) Pop 3: Stack S -> NULL
       b) print "3"
       c) current = NULL /*right of 3 */  
  
  Traversal is done now as stack S is empty and current is NULL.
