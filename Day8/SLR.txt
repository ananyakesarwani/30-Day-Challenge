Simple Linear Regression

Y= b0 + b1x

1.	Dependent and Independent Variable
        Y in above equation is dependent variable and X is Independent Variable. B is a coefficient which is a relation constant of X and Y.

2.	How to find Best Fitting Line
        Find minimum sum of squares of difference to draw a straight line.
        Steps for SLR :
            a.	Importing the libraries
            b.	Importing the dataset
            c.	Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
            d.	Training the Simple Linear Regression model on the Training set
            e.	Predicting the Test set results
            f.	Visualising the Training set results
            g.	Visualising the Test set results
