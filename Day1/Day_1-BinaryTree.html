        <h4>A binary tree is a structure comprising nodes, where each node has the following 3 components:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Data element: Stores any kind of data in the node</li>
            <li>Left pointer: Points to the tree on the left side of node</li>
            <li>Right pointer: Points to the tree on the right side of the node</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As the name suggests, the data element stores any kind of data in the node. The left and right pointers point to binary trees on the left and right side of the node respectively.</p>    
        <p> If a tree is empty, it is represented by a null pointer.</p> 
        <p>The following image explains the various components of a tree.</p>

            <strong>Commonly-used terminologies</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Root: Top node in a tree</li>
            <li>Child: Nodes that are next to each other and connected downwards</li>
            <li>Parent: Converse notion of child</li>
            <li>Siblings: Nodes with the same parent</li>
            <li>Descendant: Node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child</li>
            <li>Ancestor: Node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.</li>
            <li>Leaf: Node with no children</li>
            <li>Internal node: Node with at least one child</li>
            <li>External node: Node with no children</li>
        </ul>
